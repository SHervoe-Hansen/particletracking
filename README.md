# Particle Tracking

This lab is based on two [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org):
- `track.ipynb`: Notebook for analysing trajectories from mechanical particle simulator using image analysis;
- `mc/montecarlo.ipynb`: Notebook for running MC simulations of a model system of the mechanical particle simulator.

## Usage
To open the Notebooks, we consider two options. 1. The usage of Binder (recommended). 2. Running the Notebook on your local computer.
### 1. Binder
To open the Notebooks in Binder, simply click the Binder shield/URL in the top of the document or by clicking [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/TeamOverkill/MD_lab/HEAD).
### 2. Local computer
To open the Notebooks, install Python3 via [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), and make sure all required packages are loaded using the following terminal commands
```bash
	conda env create -f environment.yml
	source activate particletracking
	jupyter-notebook
```

## Evaluation
Each student is expected to hand in a written report based on the two labs with the grades passed or not-passed. The written report is to be handed in no later than Tue 23/03 23:59 with the posibility of handing in a first draft no later than Fri 05/03 23:59 and recive comments no later than Fri 12/03. The report may be submitted via Canvas or email to the lab responsible
